"2:196" : {s: 2, a: 196, e: "Complete the pilgrimages, major and minor, for the sake of God. If you are prevented [from doing so], then [send] whatever offering for sacrifice you can afford, and do not shave your headsuntil the offering has reached the place of sacrifice. If any of you is ill, or has an ailment of the scalp, he should compensate by fasting, or feeding the poor, or offering sacrifice. When you are in safety, anyone wishing to take a break between the minor pilgrimage and the major one must make whatever offering he can afford. If he lacks the means, he should fast for three days during the pilgrimage, and seven days on his return, making ten days in all. This applies to those whose household is not near the Sacred Mosque. Always be mindful of God, and be aware that He is stern in His retribution.", b: "আর তোমরা আল্লাহর উদ্দেশ্যে হজ্জ্ব ওমরাহ পরিপূর্ণ ভাবে পালন কর। যদি তোমরা বাধা প্রাপ্ত হও, তাহলে কোরবানীর জন্য যাকিছু সহজলভ্য, তাই তোমাদের উপর ধার্য। আর তোমরা ততক্ষণ পর্যন্ত মাথা মুন্ডন করবে না, যতক্ষণ না কোরবাণী যথাস্থানে পৌছে যাবে। যারা তোমাদের মধ্যে অসুস্থ হয়ে পড়বে কিংবা মাথায় যদি কোন কষ্ট থাকে, তাহলে তার পরিবর্তে রোজা করবে কিংবা খয়রাত দেবে অথবা কুরবানী করবে। আর তোমাদের মধ্যে যারা হজ্জ্ব ওমরাহ একত্রে একই সাথে পালন করতে চাও, তবে যাকিছু সহজলভ্য, তা দিয়ে কুরবানী করাই তার উপর কর্তব্য। বস্তুতঃ যারা কোরবানীর পশু পাবে না, তারা হজ্জ্বের দিনগুলোর মধ্যে রোজা রাখবে তিনটি আর সাতটি রোযা রাখবে ফিরে যাবার পর। এভাবে দশটি রোযা পূর্ণ হয়ে যাবে। এ নির্দেশটি তাদের জন্য, যাদের পরিবার পরিজন মসজিদুল হারামের আশে-পাশে বসবাস করে না। আর আল্লাহকে ভয় করতে থাক। সন্দেহাতীতভাবে জেনো যে, আল্লাহর আযাব বড়ই কঠিন।"},
