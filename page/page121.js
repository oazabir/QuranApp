"5:79" : {s: 5, a: 79, e: "they did not forbid each other to do wrong. How vile their deeds were!", b: "তারা পরস্পরকে মন্দ কাজে নিষেধ করত না, যা তারা করত। তারা যা করত তা অবশ্যই মন্দ ছিল"},
"5:80" : {s: 5, a: 80, e: "You [Prophet] see many of them allying themselves with the disbelievers. How terrible is what their souls have stored up for them: God is angry with them and they will remain tormented.", b: "আপনি তাদের অনেককে দেখবেন, কাফেরদের সাথে বন্ধুত্ব করে। তারা নিজেদের জন্য যা পাঠিয়েছে তা অবশ্যই মন্দ। তা এই যে, তাদের প্রতি আল্লাহ ক্রোধান্বিত হয়েছেন এবং তারা চিরকাল আযাবে থাকবে।"},

"5:82" : {s: 5, a: 82, e: "You [Prophet] are sure to find that the most hostile to the believers are the Jews and those who associate other deities with God; you are sure to find that the closest in affection towards the believers are those who say, &lsquo;We are Christians,&rsquo; for there are among them people devoted to learning and ascetics. These people are not given to arrogance,", b: "আপনি সব মানুষের চাইতে মুসলমানদের অধিক শত্রু ইহুদী ও মুশরেকদেরকে পাবেন এবং আপনি সবার চাইতে মুসলমানদের সাথে বন্ধুত্বে অধিক নিকটবর্তী তাদেরকে পাবেন, যারা নিজেদেরকে খ্রীষ্টান বলে। এর কারণ এই যে, খ্রীষ্টানদের মধ্যে আলেম রয়েছে, দরবেশ রয়েছে এবং তারা অহঙ্কার করে না।"},
