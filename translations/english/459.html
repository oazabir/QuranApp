<p class="verse"><a name="39:6" />6: He created you all from a single being, from which He made its mate; He gave you four kinds of livestock in pairs; He creates you in your mothers&rsquo; wombs, in one stage after another, in threefold depths of darkness. Such is God, your Lord; He holds control, there is no god but Him. How can you turn away?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:7" />7: If you are ungrateful, remember God has no need of you, yet He is not pleased by ingrati-tude in His servants; if you are grateful, He is pleased [to see] it in you. No soul will bear another&rsquo;s burden. You will return to your Lord in the end and He will inform you of what you have done: He knows well what is in the depths of [your] hearts.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:8" />8: When man suffers some affliction, he prays to his Lord and turns to Him, but once he has been granted a favour from God, he forgets the One he had been praying to and sets up rivals to God, to make others stray from His path. Say, &lsquo;Enjoy your ingratitude for a little while: you will be one of the inhabitants of the Fire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:9" />9: What about someone who worships devoutly during the night, bowing down, standing in prayer, ever mindful of the life to come, hoping for his Lord&rsquo;s mercy? Say, &lsquo;How can those who know be equal to those who do not know?&rsquo; Only those who have understanding will take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:10" />10: Say, &lsquo;[God says], believing servants, be mindful of your Lord! Those who do good in this world will have a good reward- God&rsquo;s earth is wide&ndash;&ndash;and those who persevere patiently will be given a full and unstinting reward.&rsquo;</p>
