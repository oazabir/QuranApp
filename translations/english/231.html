<p class="verse"><a name="11:82" />82: And so when what We had ordained came about, We turned their town upside down and rained down stones of baked clay on it, layer upon layer,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:83" />83: marked from your Lord. It is not far from the evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:84" />84: And to Midian, We sent their brother Shuayb. He said, &lsquo;My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him. Do not give short measure nor short weight. I see you are prospering, but I fear you will have torment on an overwhelming Day.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:85" />85: My people, in fairness, give full measure and weight. Do not withhold from people things that are rightly theirs, and do not spread corruption in the land.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:86" />86: What lasts with God is best for you, if you are believers: I am not your keeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:87" />87: They said, &lsquo;Shuayb, does your prayer tell you that we should abandon what our forefathers worshipped and refrain from doing whatever we please with our own property? Indeed you are a tolerant and sensible man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:88" />88: He answered, &lsquo;My people, can you not see? What if I am acting on clear evidence from my Lord? He Himself has given me good provision: I do not want to do what I am forbidding you to do, I only want to put things right as far as I can. I cannot succeed without God&rsquo;s help: I trust in Him, and always turn to Him.</p>
