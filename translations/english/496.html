<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:1" />1: Ha Mim</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:2" />2: By the Scripture that makes things clear,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:3" />3: truly We sent it down on a blessed night&ndash;&ndash;We have always sent warnings&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:4" />4: a night when every matter of wisdom was made distinct</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:5" />5: at Our command&ndash;&ndash;We have always sent messages to man&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:6" />6: as a mercy [Prophet] from your Lord who sees and knows all,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:7" />7: Lord of the heavens and the earth and everything between&ndash;&ndash;if only you people were firm believers&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:8" />8: there is no god but Him: He gives life and death&ndash;&ndash;He is your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:9" />9: yet in [their state of] doubt they take nothing seriously.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:10" />10: [Prophet], watch out for the Day when the sky brings forth clouds of smoke for all to see.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:11" />11: It will envelop the people. They will cry, &lsquo;This is a terrible torment!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:12" />12: Lord relieve us from this torment! We believe!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:13" />13: How will this [sudden] faith benefit them? When a prophet came to warn them plainly,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:14" />14: they turned their backs on him, saying, &lsquo;He is tutored! He is possessed!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:15" />15: We shall hold the torment back for a while &ndash;&ndash;you are sure to return [to Us]&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:16" />16: and on the Day We seize [them] mightily We shall exact retribution.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:17" />17: We tested the people of Pharaoh before them: a noble messenger was sent to them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="44:18" />18: saying, &lsquo;Hand the servants of God over to me! I am a faithful messenger who has been sent to you.</p>
