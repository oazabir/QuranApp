<p class="verse"><a name="41:49" />49: Man never tires of asking for good, but if evil touches him he loses all hope and becomes despondent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="41:50" />50: Whenever We let him taste some of Our mercy after he has been afflicted, he is sure to say, &lsquo;This is all my own doing: I do not think the Hour will ever come, but even if I were to be taken back to my Lord, the best reward would await me with Him.&rsquo; We shall most certainly inform the disbelievers of what they have done and give them a taste of severe torment.</p>
