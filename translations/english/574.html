<p class="surah">Al-Muzzammil</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:1" />1: You [Prophet], enfolded in your cloak!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:2" />2: Stay up throughout the night, all but a small part of it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:3" />3: half, or a little less,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:4" />4: or a little more; recite the Quran slowly and distinctly:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:5" />5: We shall send a momentous message down to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:6" />6: Night prayer makes a deeper impression and sharpens words&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:7" />7: you are kept busy for long periods of the day&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:8" />8: so celebrate the name of your Lord and devote yourself wholeheart-edly to Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:9" />9: He is Lord of the east and west, there is no god but Him, so take Him as your Protector,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:10" />10: patiently endure what they say, ignore them politely,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:11" />11: and leave to Me those who deny the truth and live in luxury. Bear with them for a little while;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:12" />12: We have fetters, a blazing fire,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:13" />13: food that chokes, and agonizing torment in store for them</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:14" />14: on the Day when the earth and the mountains will shake. The mountains will become a heap of loose sand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:15" />15: We have sent a messenger to you [people] to be your witness, just as We sent a messenger to Pharaoh,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:16" />16: but Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger and so We inflicted a heavy punishment on him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:17" />17: So if you disbelieve, how can you guard yourselves against a Day that will turn children&rsquo;s hair grey,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:18" />18: a Day when the sky will be torn apart? God&rsquo;s promise will certainly be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="73:19" />19: This is a reminder. Let whoever wishes take the way to his Lord.</p>
