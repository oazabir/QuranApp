<p class="verse"><a name="34:41" />41: They will reply, &lsquo;May You be exalted! You are our supporter against them! Really, they worshipped the jinn- most of them believed in them.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:42" />42: &lsquo;So today neither of you has any power to benefit or harm the other,&rsquo; We shall tell the evildoers, &lsquo;Taste the torment of the fire which you called a lie.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:43" />43: When Our messages are recited to them, clear as they are, they say, &lsquo;This is only a man who wants to turn you away from what your forefathers worshipped,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;This [Quran] is nothing but lies he has made up.&rsquo; When the Truth comes to the disbelievers, they say, &lsquo;This is just plain sorcery,&rsquo;</p>
