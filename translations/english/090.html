<p class="verse"><a name="4:75" />75: Why should you not fight in God&rsquo;s cause and for those oppressed men, women, and children who cry out, &lsquo;Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors! By Your grace, give us a protector and give us a helper!&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:76" />76: The believers fight for God&rsquo;s cause, while those who reject faith fight for an unjust cause. Fight the allies of Satan: Satan&rsquo;s strategies are truly weak.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:77" />77: [Prophet], do you not see those who were told, &lsquo;Restrain yourselves from fighting, perform the prayer, and pay the prescribed alms&rsquo;? When fighting was ordained for them, some of them feared men as much as, or even more than, they feared God, saying, &lsquo;Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? If only You would give us just a little more time.&rsquo; Say to them, &lsquo;Little is the enjoyment in this world, the Hereafter is far better for those who are mindful of God: you will not be wronged by as much as the fibre in a date stone.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:78" />78: Death will overtake you no matter where you may be, even inside high towers.&rsquo; When good fortune comes their way, they say, &lsquo;This is from God,&rsquo; but when harm befalls them, they say, &lsquo;This is from you [Prophet].&rsquo; Say to them, &lsquo;Both come from God.&rsquo; What is the matter with these people that they can barely understand what they are told?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:79" />79: Anything good that happens to you [Prophet] is from God; anything bad is [ultimately] from yourself. We have sent you as a messenger to people; God is sufficient witness.</p>
