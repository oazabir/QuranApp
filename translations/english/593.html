<p class="surah">Al-Fajr</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:1" />1: By the Daybreak,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:2" />2: by the Ten Nights,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:3" />3: by the even and the odd,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:4" />4: by the passing night&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:5" />5: is this oath strong enough for a rational person?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:6" />6: Have you [Prophet] considered how your Lord dealt with [the people] of 'Ad,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:7" />7: of Iram, [the city] of lofty pillars,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:8" />8: whose like has never been made in any land,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:9" />9: and the Thamud, who hewed into the rocks in the valley,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:10" />10: and the mighty and powerful Pharaoh?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:11" />11: All of them committed excesses in their lands,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:12" />12: and spread corruption there:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:13" />13: your Lord let a scourge of punishment loose on them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:14" />14: Your Lord is always watchful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:15" />15: [The nature of] man is that, when his Lord tries him through honour and blessings, he says, &lsquo;My Lord has honoured me,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:16" />16: but when He tries him through the restriction of his provision, he says, &lsquo;My Lord has humiliated me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:17" />17: No indeed! You [people] do not honour orphans,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:18" />18: you do not urge one another to feed the poor,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:19" />19: you consume inheritance greedily,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:20" />20: and you love wealth with a passion.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:21" />21: No indeed! When the earth is pounded to dust, pounded and pounded,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:22" />22: when your Lord comes with the angels, rank upon rank,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="89:23" />23: when Hell is that Day brought near- on that Day man will take heed, but what good will that be to him then?</p>
