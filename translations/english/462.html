<p class="verse"><a name="39:32" />32: So who could be more wrong than the person who invents a lie about God and rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not ample punishment for the disbelievers in Hell?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:33" />33: It is the one who brings the truth and the one who accepts it as true who are mindful of God:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:34" />34: they will have everything they wish for with their Lord. Such is the reward of those who do good:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:35" />35: God will absolve them even of their worst deeds and will reward them according to their best.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:36" />36: Is God not enough for His servant? Yet they threaten you [Prophet] with those they worship other than Him. If God allows someone to stray he has no one to guide him;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:37" />37: if God guides someone no one can lead him astray. Is God not mighty and capable of retribution?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:38" />38: If you [Prophet] ask them, &lsquo;Who created the heavens and earth?&rsquo; they are sure to answer, &lsquo;God,&rsquo; so say, &lsquo;Consider those you invoke beside Him: if God wished to harm me, could they undo that harm? If God wished to show me mercy, could they withhold that mercy?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God is enough for me: all those who trust should put their trust in Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:39" />39: Say, &lsquo;My people, do whatever is in your power- and so will I. You will find out</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="39:40" />40: who will suffer humiliation, and on whom a lasting torment will descend.&rsquo;</p>
