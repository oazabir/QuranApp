<p class="verse"><a name="42:17" />17: It is God who has sent down the Scripture with Truth and the Balance. How can you tell? The Last Hour may well be near:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:18" />18: those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, but the believers stand in awe of it. They know it to be the Truth; those who argue about the Hour are far, far astray.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:19" />19: God is most subtle towards His creatures; He provides [bounti-fully] for whoever He will; He is the Powerful, the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:20" />20: If anyone desires a harvest in the life to come, We shall increase it for him; if anyone desires a harvest in this world, We shall give him a share of it, but in the Hereafter he will have no share.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:21" />21: How can they believe in others who ordain for them things which God has not sanctioned in the practice of their faith? If it were not for God&rsquo;s decree concerning the final Decision, judgement would already have been made between them. The evildoers will have a grievous punishment-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="42:22" />22: you will see them fearful because of what they have done: punishment is bound to fall on them- but those who believe and do good deeds will be in the flowering meadows of the Gardens. They will have whatever they wish from their Lord: this is the great bounty;</p>
