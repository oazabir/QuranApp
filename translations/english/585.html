<p class="verse"><a name="80:1" />1: He frowned and turned away</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:2" />2: when the blind man came to him&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:3" />3: for all you know, he might have grown in spirit,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:4" />4: or taken note of something useful to him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:5" />5: For the self-satisfied one</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:6" />6: you go out of your way&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:7" />7: though you are not to be blamed for his lack of spiritual growth&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:8" />8: but from the one who has come to you full of eagerness</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:9" />9: and awe</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:10" />10: you allow yourself to be distracted.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="80:14" />14: exalted, pure pages,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:15" />15: by the hands of</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:16" />16: noble and virtuous scribes.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:17" />17: Woe to man! How ungrateful he is!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:18" />18: From what thing does God create him?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:19" />19: He creates him from a droplet, He proportions him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:20" />20: He makes the way easy for him,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:21" />21: then He causes him to die and be buried.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:22" />22: When He wills, He will raise him up again.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:23" />23: Yet mandoes not fulfil God&rsquo;s commands.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:24" />24: Let man consider the food he eats!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:25" />25: We pour down abundant water</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:26" />26: and cause the soil to split open.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:27" />27: We make grain grow,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:28" />28: and vines, fresh vegetation,</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="80:34" />34: the Day man will flee from his own brother,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:35" />35: his mother, his father,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:36" />36: his wife, his children:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:37" />37: each of them will be absorbed in concerns of their own on that Day-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:38" />38: on that Day some faces will be beaming,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:39" />39: laughing, and rejoicing,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:40" />40: but some faces will be dust-stained</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:41" />41: and covered in darkness:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="80:42" />42: those are the disbelievers, the licentious.</p>
