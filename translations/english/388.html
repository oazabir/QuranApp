<p class="verse"><a name="28:22" />22: As he made his way towards Midian, he was saying, &lsquo;May my Lord guide me to the right way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:23" />23: When he arrived at Midian&rsquo;s waters, he found a group of men watering [their flocks], and beside them two women keeping their flocks back, so he said, &lsquo;What is the matter with you two?&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We cannot water [our flocks] until the shepherds take their sheep away: our father is a very old man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:24" />24: He watered their flocks for them, withdrew into the shade, and prayed, &lsquo;My Lord, I am in dire need of whatever good thing You may send me,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:25" />25: and then one of the two women approached him, walking shyly, and said, &lsquo;My father is asking for you: he wants to reward you for watering our flocks for us.&rsquo; When Moses came to him and told him his story, the old man said, &lsquo;Do not be afraid, you are safe now from people who do wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:26" />26: One of the women said, &lsquo;Father, hire him: a strong, trustworthy man is the best to hire.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:27" />27: The father said, &lsquo;I would like to marry you to one of these daughters of mine, on condition that you serve me for eight years: if you complete ten, it will be of your own free will. I do not intend to make things difficult for you: God willing, you will find I am a fair man.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="28:28" />28: Moses said, &lsquo;Let that be the agreement between us- whichever of the two terms I fulfil, let there be no injustice to me- God is witness to what we say.&rsquo;</p>
