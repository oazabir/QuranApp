<p class="verse"><a name="2:89" />89: When a Scripture came to them from God confirming what they already had, and when they had been praying for victory against the disbelievers, even when there came to them something they knew [to be true], they disbelieved in it: God rejects those who disbelieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:90" />90: Low indeed is the price for which they have sold their souls by denying the God-sent truth, out of envy that God should send His bounty to any of His servants He pleases. The disbelievers have ended up with wrath upon wrath, and a humiliating torment awaits them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:91" />91: When it is said to them, &lsquo;Believe in God&rsquo;s revelations,&rsquo; they reply, &lsquo;We believe in what was revealed to us,&rsquo; but they do not believe in what came afterwards, though it is the truth confirming what they already have. Say [Muhammad], &lsquo;Why did you kill God&rsquo;s prophets in the past if you were true believers?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:92" />92: Moses brought you clear signs, but then, while he was away, you chose to worship the calf- you did wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:93" />93: Remember when We took your pledge, making the mountain tower above you, and said, &lsquo;Hold on firmly to what We have given you, and listen to [what We say].&rsquo; They said, &lsquo;We hear and we disobey,&rsquo; and through their disbelief they were made to drink [the love of] the calf deep into their hearts.</p>
