<p class="surah">Qaf</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:1" />1: Qaf By the glorious Quran!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:2" />2: But the disbelievers are amazed that a warner has come from among them and they say, &lsquo;How strange!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:3" />3: To come back [to life] after we have died and become dust? That is too farfetched.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:4" />4: We know very well what the earth takes away from them: We keep a comprehensive record.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:5" />5: But the disbelievers deny the truth when it comes to them; they are in a state of confusion.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:6" />6: Do they not see the sky above them&ndash;&ndash;how We have built and adorned it, with no rifts in it;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:7" />7: how We spread out the earth and put solid mountains on it, and caused every kind of joyous plant to grow in it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:8" />8: as a lesson and reminder for every servant who turns to God;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:9" />9: and how We send blessed water down from the sky and grow with it gardens, the harvest grain,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:10" />10: and tall palm trees laden with clusters of dates,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:11" />11: as a provision for everyone; how with water We give [new] life to a land that is dead? This is how the dead will emerge [from their graves].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:12" />12: The people of Noah disbelieved long before these disbelievers, as did the people of Rass, Thamud,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:13" />13: Ad, Pharaoh, Lot,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:14" />14: the Forest-Dwellers, Tubba: all of these people disbelieved their messengers, and so My warning was realized.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:15" />15: So were We incapable of the first creation? No indeed! Yet they doubt a second creation.</p>
