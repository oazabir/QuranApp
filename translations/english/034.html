<p class="verse"><a name="2:216" />216: Fighting is ordained for you, though you dislike it. You may dislike something although it is good for you, or like something although it is bad for you: God knows and you do not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:217" />217: They ask you [Prophet] about fighting in the prohibited month. Say, &lsquo;Fighting in that month is a great offence, but to bar others from God&rsquo;s path, to disbelieve in Him, prevent access to the Sacred Mosque, and expel its people, are still greater offences in God&rsquo;s eyes: persecution is worse than killing.&rsquo; They will not stop fighting you [believers] until they make you revoke your faith, if they can. If any of you revoke your faith and die as disbelievers, your deeds will come to nothing in this world and the Hereafter, and you will be inhabitants of the Fire, there to remain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:218" />218: But those who have believed, migrated, and striven for God&rsquo;s cause, it is they who can look forward to God&rsquo;s mercy: God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:219" />219: They ask you [Prophet] about intoxicants and gambling: say, &lsquo;There is great sin in both, and some benefit for people: the sin is greater than the benefit.&rsquo; They ask you what they should give: say, &lsquo;Give what you can spare.&rsquo; In this way, God makes His messages clear to you, so that you may reflect</p>
