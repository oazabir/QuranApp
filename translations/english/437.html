<p class="verse"><a name="35:19" />19: The blind and the seeing are not alike,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:20" />20: nor are darkness and light;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:21" />21: shade and heat are not alike,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:22" />22: nor are the living and the dead. God makes anyone He wills hear [His message]: you cannot make those in their graves hear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:23" />23: You are only here to warn them-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:24" />24: We have sent you with the Truth as a bearer of good news and warning- every community has been sent a warner.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:25" />25: If they call you a liar, their predecessors did the same: messengers came to them with clear signs, scriptures, and enlightening revelation</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:26" />26: and afterwards I seized the disbelievers- how terrible My punishment was!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:27" />27: Have you [Prophet] not considered how God sends water down from the sky and that We produce with it fruits of varied colours; that there are in the mountains layers of white and red of various hues, and jet black;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:28" />28: that there are various colours among human beings, wild animals, and livestock too? It is those of His servants who have knowledge who stand in true awe of God. God is almighty, most forgiving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:29" />29: Those who recite God&rsquo;s scripture, keep up the prayer, give secretly and openly from what We have provided for them, may hope for a trade that will never decline:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:30" />30: He will repay them in full, and give them extra from His bounty. He is most forgiving, most appreciative.</p>
