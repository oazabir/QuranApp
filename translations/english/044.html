<p class="verse"><a name="2:260" />260: And when Abraham said, &lsquo;My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead,&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Do you not believe, then?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Abraham, &lsquo;but just to put my heart at rest.&rsquo; So God said, &lsquo;Take four birds and train them to come back to you. Then place them on separate hilltops, call them back, and they will come flying to you: know that God is all powerful and wise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:261" />261: Those who spend their wealth in God&rsquo;s cause are like grains of corn that produce seven ears, each bearing a hundred grains. God gives multiple increase to whoever He wishes: He is limitless and all knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:262" />262: Those who spend their wealth in God&rsquo;s cause, and do not follow their spending with reminders of their benevolence or hurtful words, will have their rewards with their Lord: no fear for them, nor will they grieve.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:263" />263: A kind word and forgiveness is better than a charitable deed followed by hurtful [words]: God is self-sufficient, forbearing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:264" />264: You who believe, do not cancel out your charitable deeds with reminders and hurtful words, like someone who spends his wealth only to be seen by people, not believing in God and the Last Day. Such a person is like a rock with earth on it: heavy rain falls and leaves it completely bare. Such people get no rewards for their works: God does not guide the disbelievers.</p>
