<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:1" />1: [How] prosperous are the believers!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:2" />2: Those who pray humbly,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:3" />3: who shun idle talk,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:4" />4: who pay the prescribed alms,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:5" />5: who guard their chastity</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:6" />6: except with their spouses or their slaves&ndash;&ndash;with these they are not to blame,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:7" />7: but anyone who seeks more than this is exceeding the limits&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:8" />8: who are faithful to their trusts and pledges</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:9" />9: and who keep up their prayers,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:10" />10: will rightly be given</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:11" />11: Paradise as their own, there to remain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:12" />12: We created man from an essence of clay,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:13" />13: then We placed him as a drop of fluid in a safe place,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:14" />14: then We made that drop into a clinging form, and We made that form into a lump of flesh, and We made that lump into bones, and We clothed those bones with flesh, and later We made him into other forms&ndash;&ndash;glory be to God, the best of creators!&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:15" />15: then you will die</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:16" />16: and then, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be raised up again.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:17" />17: We created seven levels above you: We are never unmindful of Our creation.</p>
