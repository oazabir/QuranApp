<p class="verse"><a name="5:51" />51: You who believe, do not take the Jews and Christians as allies:they are allies only to each other. Anyone who takes them as an ally becomes one of them- God does not guide such wrongdoers-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:52" />52: yet you [Prophet] will see the perverse at heart rushing to them for protection, saying, &lsquo;We are afraid fortune may turn against us.&rsquo; But God may well bring about a triumph or some other event of His own making: then they will rue the secrets they harboured in their hearts,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:53" />53: and the believers will say, &lsquo;Are these the men who swore by God using their strongest oaths that they were with you?&rsquo; All they did was in vain: they have lost everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:54" />54: You who believe, if any of you go back on your faith, God will soon replace you with people He loves and who love Him, people who are humble towards the believers, hard on the disbelievers, and who strive in God&rsquo;s way without fearing anyone&rsquo;s reproach. Such is God&rsquo;s favour. He grants it to whoever He will. God has endless bounty and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:55" />55: Your true allies are God, His Messenger, and the believers- those who keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, and bow down in worship.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:56" />56: Those who turn for protection to God, His Messenger, and the believers [are God&rsquo;s party]: God&rsquo;s party is sure to triumph.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:57" />57: You who believe, do not take as allies those who ridicule your religion and make fun of it- whether people who were given the Scripture before you, or disbelievers- and be mindful of God if you are true believers.</p>
