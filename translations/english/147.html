<p class="verse"><a name="6:143" />143: [God gave you] eight animals, in [four] pairs: a pair of sheep and a pair of goats- ask them [Prophet], &lsquo;Has He forbidden the two males, the two females, or the young in the wombs of the two females? Tell me based on knowledge if you are telling the truth.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:144" />144: And a pair of camels and a pair of cattle- ask them [Prophet], &lsquo;Has He forbidden the two males, the two females, or the young in the wombs of the two females? Were you present when God gave you these commands?&rsquo; So who is more wicked than he who fabricates lies against God with no basis in knowledge in order to lead people astray? God does not guide the evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:145" />145: [Prophet], say, &lsquo;In all that has been revealed to me, I find nothing forbidden for people to eat, except for carrion, flowing blood, pig&rsquo;s meat- it is loathsome- or a sinful offering over which any name other than God&rsquo;s has been invoked.&rsquo; But if someone is forced by hunger, rather than desire or excess, then God is most forgiving and most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:146" />146: We forbade for the Jews every animal with claws, and the fat of cattle and sheep, except what is on their backs and in their intestines, or that which sticks to their bones. This is how We penalized them for their disobedience: We are true to Our word.</p>
