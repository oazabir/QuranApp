<p class="verse"><a name="19:77" />77: Have you considered the man who rejects Our revelation, who says, &lsquo;I will certainly be given wealth and children&rsquo;?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:78" />78: Has he penetrated the unknown or received a pledge to that effect from the Lord of Mercy?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:79" />79: No! We shall certainly record what he says and prolong his punishment:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:80" />80: We shall inherit from him all that he speaks of and he will come to Us all alone.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:81" />81: They have taken other gods beside God to give them strength,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:82" />82: but these gods will reject their worship and will even turn against them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:83" />83: Have you [Prophet] not seen how We send devils to incite the disbelievers to sin?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:84" />84: There is no need for you to be impatient concerning them: We are counting down their [allotted] time.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:85" />85: On the Day We gather the righteous as an honoured company before the Lord of Mercy</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:86" />86: and drive the sinful like a thirsty herd into Hell,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:87" />87: no one will have power to intercede except for those who have permission from the Lord of Mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:88" />88: The disbelievers say, &lsquo;The Lord of Mercy has offspring.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:89" />89: How terrible is this thing you assert:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:90" />90: it almost causes the heavens to be torn apart, the earth to split asunder, the mountains to crumble to pieces,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:91" />91: that they attribute offspring to the Lord of Mercy.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:92" />92: It does not befit the Lord of Mercy [to have offspring]:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:93" />93: there is no one in the heavens or earth who will not come to the Lord of Mercy as a servant-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:94" />94: He has counted them all: He has numbered them exactly-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:95" />95: and they will each return to Him on the Day of Resurrection all alone.</p>
