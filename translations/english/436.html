<p class="verse"><a name="35:12" />12: The two bodies of water are not alike- one is palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, the other salty and bitter- yet from each you eat fresh fish and extract ornaments to wear, and in each you see the ships ploughing their course so that you may seek God&rsquo;s bounty and be grateful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:13" />13: He makes the night merge into the day and the day into the night; He has subjected the sun and the moon- each runs for an appointed term. Such is God your Lord: all control belongs to Him. Those you invoke beside Him do not even control the skin of a date stone;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:14" />14: if you call them they cannot hear you; if they could hear, they could not answer you; on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your idolatry. None can inform you [Prophet] like the One who is all aware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:15" />15: People, it is you who stand in need of God- God needs nothing and is worthy of all praise-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:16" />16: if He wills, He can do away with you and bring in a new creation,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:17" />17: that is not difficult for God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="35:18" />18: No burdened soul will bear the burden of another: even if a heavily laden soul should cry for help, none of its load will be carried, not even by a close relative. But you [Prophet] can only warn those who fear their Lord, though they cannot see Him, and keep up the prayer- whoever purifies himself does so for his own benefit&ndash;&ndash; everything returns to God.</p>
