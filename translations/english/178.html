<p class="verse"><a name="8:9" />9: When you begged your Lord for help, He answered you, &lsquo;I will reinforce you with a thousand angels in succession.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:10" />10: God made this a message of hope to reassure your hearts: help comes only from God, He is mighty and wise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:11" />11: Remember when He gave you sleep as a reassurance from Him, and sent down water from the sky to cleanse you, to remove Satan&rsquo;s pollution from you, to make your hearts strong and your feet firm.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:12" />12: Your Lord revealed to the angels: &lsquo;I am with you: give the believers firmness; I shall put terror into the hearts of the disbelievers- strike above their necks and strike all their fingertips.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:13" />13: That was because they opposed God and His Messenger, and if anyone opposes God and His Messenger, God punishes them severely-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:14" />14: &lsquo;That is what you get! Taste that!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;and the torment of the Fire awaits the disbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:15" />15: Believers, when you meet the disbelievers in battle, never turn your backs on them:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:16" />16: if anyone does so on such a day- unless maneuvring to fight or to join a fighting group- he incurs the wrath of God, and Hell will be his home, a wretched destination!</p>
