<p class="verse"><a name="4:95" />95: Those believers who stay at home, apart from those with an incapacity, are not equal to those who commit themselves and their possessions to striving in God&rsquo;s way. God has raised such people to a rank above those who stay at home- although He has promised all believers a good reward, those who strive are favoured with a tremendous reward above those who stay at home-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:96" />96: high ranks conferred by Him, as well as forgiveness, and mercy: God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:97" />97: When the angels take the souls of those who have wronged themselves, they ask them, &lsquo;What circumstances were you in?&rsquo; They reply, &lsquo;We were oppressed in this land,&rsquo; and the angels say, &lsquo;But was God&rsquo;s earth not spacious enough for you to migrate to some other place?&rsquo; These people will have Hell as their refuge, an evil destination,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:98" />98: but not so the truly helpless men, women, and children who have no means in their power nor any way to leave-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:99" />99: God may well pardon these, for He is most pardoning and most forgiving. Anyone who migrates for God&rsquo;s cause will find many a refuge and great plenty in the earth,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:100" />100: and if anyone leaves home as a migrant towards God and His Messenger and is then overtaken by death, his reward from God is sure. God is most forgiving and most merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:101" />101: When you [believers] are travelling in the land, you will not be blamed for shortening your prayers, if you fear the disbelievers may harm you: they are your sworn enemies.</p>
