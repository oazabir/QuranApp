<p class="verse"><a name="54:9" />9: The people of Noah rejected the truth before them: they rejected Our servant, saying, &lsquo;He is mad!&rsquo; Noah was rebuked,</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="54:11" />11: So We opened the gates of the sky with torrential water,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:12" />12: burst the earth with gushing springs: the waters met for a preordained purpose.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="54:14" />14: that floated under Our watchful eye, a reward for the one who had been rejected.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:15" />15: We have left this as a sign: will anyone take heed?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:16" />16: How [terrible] was My punishment and [the fulfilment of] My warnings!</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="54:24" />24: they said, &lsquo;What? A man? Why should we follow a lone man from amongst ourselves? That would be misguided; quite insane!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:25" />25: Would a mes-sage be given to him alone out of all of us? No, he is an insolent liar!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:26" />26: &lsquo;Tomorrow they will know who is the insolent liar,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="54:27" />27: for We shall send them a she-camel to test them: so watch them [Salih] and be patient.</p>
