<p class="verse"><a name="36:28" />28: After him We did not send any army from heaven against his people, nor were We about to:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:29" />29: there was just one blast, and they fell down lifeless.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:30" />30: Alas for human beings! Whenever a messenger comes to them they ridicule him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:31" />31: Do they not see how many generations We have destroyed before them, none of whom will ever come back to them?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:32" />32: [Yet] all of them will be brought before Us.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:33" />33: There is a sign for them in the lifeless earth: We give it life and We produce grain from it for them to eat;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:34" />34: We have put gardens of date palms and grapes in the earth, and We have made springs of water gush out of it</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:35" />35: so that they could eat its fruit. It was not their own hands that made all this. How can they not give thanks?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:36" />36: Glory be to Him who created all the pairs of things that the earth produces, as well as themselves and other things they do not know about.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="36:38" />38: The sun, too, runs its determined course laid down for it by the Almighty, the All Knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:39" />39: We have determined phases for the moon until finally it becomes like an old date-stalk.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="36:40" />40: The sun cannot overtake the moon, nor can the night outrun the day: each floats in [its own] orbit.</p>
