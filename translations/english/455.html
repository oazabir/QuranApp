<p class="verse"><a name="38:27" />27: It was not without purpose that We created the heavens and the earth and everything in between. That may be what the disbelievers assume- how they will suffer from the Fire!-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:28" />28: but would We treat those who believe and do good deeds and those who spread corruption on earth as equal? Would We treat those who are aware of God and those who recklessly break all bounds in the same way?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:29" />29: This is a blessed Scripture which We sent down to you [Muhammad], for people to think about its messages, and for those with understanding to take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:30" />30: We gave David Solomon. He was an excellent servant who always turned to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:31" />31: When well-bred light-footed horses were paraded before him near the close of day,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:32" />32: he kept saying, &lsquo;My love of fine things is part of my remembering my Lord!&rsquo; until [the horses] disappeared from sight-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:33" />33: &lsquo;Bring them back!&rsquo; [he said] and started to stroke their legs and necks.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:34" />34: We certainly tested Solomon, reducing him to a mere skeleton on his throne.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:35" />35: He turned to Us and prayed: &lsquo;Lord forgive me! Grant me such power as no one after me will have- You are the Most Generous Provider.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:36" />36: So We gave him power over the wind, which at his request ran gently wherever he willed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:37" />37: and the jinn&ndash;&ndash;every kind of builder and diver</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:38" />38: and others chained in fetters.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:39" />39: &lsquo;This is Our gift, so give or withhold as you wish without account.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:40" />40: His reward will be nearness to Us, and a good place to return to.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:41" />41: Bring to mind Our servant Job who cried to his Lord, &lsquo;Satan has afflicted me with weariness and suffering.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:42" />42: &lsquo;Stamp your foot! Here is cool water for you to wash in and drink,&rsquo;</p>
