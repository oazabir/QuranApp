<p class="verse"><a name="14:6" />6: And so Moses said to his people, &lsquo;Remember God&rsquo;s blessing on you when He saved you from Pharaoh&rsquo;s people, who were inflicting terrible suffering on you, slaughtering your sons and sparing only your women&ndash;&ndash;that was a severe test from your Lord!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:7" />7: Remember that He promised, &ldquo;If you are thankful, I will give you more, but if you are thankless, My punishment is terrible indeed.&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:8" />8: And Moses said, &lsquo;Even if you, together with everybody else on earth, are thankless, God is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:9" />9: Have you not heard about those who went before you, the people of Noah, Ad, Thamud, and those who lived after them, known only to God? Their messengers came to them with clear proof, but they tried to silence them, saying, &lsquo;We do not believe the message with which you were sent. We have disturbing doubts about what you are asking us to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="14:10" />10: Their messengers answered, &lsquo;Can there be any doubt about God, the Creator of the heavens and earth? He calls you to Him in order to forgive you your sins and let you enjoy your life until the appointed hour.&rsquo; But they said, &lsquo;You are only men like us. You want to turn us away from what our forefathers used to worship. Bring us clear proof then, [if you can].&rsquo;</p>
