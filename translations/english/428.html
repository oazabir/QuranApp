<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:1" />1: Praise be to God, to whom belongs all that is in the heavens and earth, and praise be to Him in the life to come. He is the All Wise, the All Aware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:2" />2: He knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it; He knows all that comes down from the heavens and all that goes up to them. He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:3" />3: Still, the disbelievers say, &lsquo;The Last Hour will never come upon us.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Yes, by my Lord, [it will], by Him who knows the unseen! Not even the weight of a speck of dust in the heavens or earth escapes His knowledge, nor anything smaller or greater. It is all recorded in a clear Record</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:4" />4: so that He can reward those who believe and do good deeds: they will have forgiveness and generous provision.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:5" />5: But as for those who work against Our Revelations, seeking to undermine them, there will be a torment of painful suffering.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:6" />6: [Prophet], those who have been given knowledge can see that what has been sent to you from your Lord is the truth, and that it leads to the path of the Almighty, worthy of all praise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:7" />7: But the disbelievers say, &lsquo;Shall we show you a man who claims that, when you have been utterly torn to pieces, you will be raised in a new creation?</p>
