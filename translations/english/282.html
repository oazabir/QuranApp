<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:1" />1: Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship to the furthest place of worship, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs: He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:2" />2: We also gave Moses the Scripture, and made it a guide for the Children of Israel. &lsquo;Entrust yourselves to no one but Me,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:3" />3: you descendants of those We carried with Noah: he was truly a thankful servant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:4" />4: We declared to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, &lsquo;Twice you will spread corruption in the land and become highly arrogant.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:5" />5: When the first of these warnings was fulfilled, We sent against you servants of Ours with great force, and they ravaged your homes. That warning was fulfilled,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:6" />6: but then We allowed you to prevail against your enemy. We increased your wealth and offspring and made you more numerous&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:7" />7: whether you do good or evil it is to your own souls&ndash;&ndash;and when the second warning was fulfilled [We sent them] to shame your faces and enter the place of worship as they did the first time, and utterly destroy whatever fell into their power.</p>
