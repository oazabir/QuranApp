<p class="verse"><a name="18:35" />35: He went into his garden and wronged himself by saying, &lsquo;I do not think this will ever perish,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:36" />36: or that the Last Hour will ever come- even if I were to be taken back to my Lord, I would certainly find something even better there.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:37" />37: His companion retorted, &lsquo;Have you no faith in Him who created you from dust, from a small drop of fluid, then shaped you into a man?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="18:38" />38: But, for me, He is God, my Lord, and I will never set up any partner with Him.</p>
