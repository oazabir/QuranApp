<p class="verse"><a name="79:16" />16: His Lord called out to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:17" />17: &lsquo;Go to Pharaoh, for he has exceeded all bounds,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:18" />18: and ask him, &ldquo;Do you want to purify yourself [of sin]?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:19" />19: Do you want me to guide you to your Lord, so that you may hold Him in awe?&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:20" />20: Moses showed him the great sign,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:21" />21: but he denied it and refused [the faith].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:22" />22: He turned away and hastily</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:23" />23: gathered his people, proclaiming,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:24" />24: &lsquo;I am your supreme lord,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:25" />25: so God condemned him to punishment in the life to come as well as in this life:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:26" />26: there truly is a lesson in this for anyone who stands in awe of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:27" />27: Which is harder to create: you people or the sky that He built,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:28" />28: raising it high and perfecting it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:29" />29: giving darkness to its night and bringing out its morning brightness,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:30" />30: and the earth, too, He spread out,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:31" />31: bringing waters and pastures out of it,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:32" />32: and setting firm mountains [in it]</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:33" />33: for you and your animals to enjoy?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:34" />34: When the great overwhelming event arrives</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:35" />35: on the Day that man remembers what he has done</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:36" />36: and Hell is there for all to see,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:37" />37: for anyone who has transgressed</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:38" />38: and preferred the present life</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:39" />39: Hell will be home;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:40" />40: for anyone who feared the meeting with his Lord and restrained himself from base desires,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:41" />41: Paradise will be home.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:42" />42: They ask you [Prophet] about the Hour,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:43" />43: saying, &lsquo;When will it arrive?&rsquo;, but how can you tell [them that]?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:44" />44: Its time is known only to your Lord;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:45" />45: you are only sent to warn those who fear it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="79:46" />46: On the Day they see it, it will seem they lingered [in this life] an evening [at most,] or its morning.</p>
