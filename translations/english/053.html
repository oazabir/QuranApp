<p class="verse"><a name="3:23" />23: Have you considered those who were given a share of the Scripture? When they are asked to accept judgement from God&rsquo;s Scripture, some of them turn their backs and walk away, all because they declare,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:24" />24: &lsquo;The Fire will only touch us for a limited number of days.&rsquo; The lies they have invented have led them astray in their own religion.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:25" />25: How will they fare when We gather them together for a Day of which there is no doubt, when every soul will be paid in full for what it has done, and they will not be wronged?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:26" />26: Say, &lsquo;God, holder of all control, You give control to whoever You will and remove it from whoever You will; You elevate whoever You will and humble whoever You will. All that is good lies in Your hand: You have power over everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:27" />27: You merge night into day and day into night; You bring the living out of the dead and the dead out of the living; You provide limitlessly for whoever You will.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:28" />28: The believers should not make the disbelievers their allies rather than other believers- anyone who does such a thing will isolate himself completely from God- except when you need to protect yourselves from them. God warns you to beware of Him: the Final Return is to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="3:29" />29: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;God knows everything that is in your hearts, whether you conceal or reveal it; He knows everything in the heavens and earth; God has power over all things.&rsquo;</p>
