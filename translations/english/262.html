<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:1" />1: Alif Lam Ra These are the verses of the Scripture, a Quran that makes things clear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:2" />2: The disbelievers may well come to wish they had submitted to God,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:3" />3: so [Prophet] leave them to eat and enjoy themselves. Let [false] hopes distract them: they will come to know.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:4" />4: Never have We destroyed a community that did not have a set time;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:5" />5: no community can bring its time forward, nor delay it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:6" />6: They say, &lsquo;Receiver of this Quran! You are definitely mad.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:7" />7: Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are telling the truth?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:8" />8: But We send down the angels only to bring justice and then these people will not be reprieved.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:9" />9: We have sent down the Quran Ourself, and We Ourself will guard it. Even before you [Prophet],</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:10" />10: We sent messengers among the various communities of old,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:11" />11: but they mocked every single messenger that came to them:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:12" />12: in this way We make the message slip through the hearts of evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:13" />13: They will not believe in it. That was what happened with the peoples of long ago,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:14" />14: and even if We opened a gateway into Heaven for them and they rose through it, higher and higher,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:15" />15: they would still say, &lsquo;Our eyes are hallucinating. We are bewitched.&rsquo;</p>
