<p class="verse"><a name="31:12" />12: We endowed Luqman with wisdom: &lsquo;Be thankful to God: whoever gives thanks benefits his own soul, and as for those who are thankless&ndash;&ndash;God is self-sufficient, worthy of all praise.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:13" />13: Luqman counselled his son, &lsquo;My son, do not attribute any partners to God: attributing partners to Him is a terrible wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:14" />14: We have commanded people to be good to their parents: their mothers carried them, with strain upon strain, and it takes two years to wean them. Give thanks to Me and to your parents- all will return to Me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:15" />15: If they strive to make you associate with Me anything about which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them. Yet keep their company in this life according to what is right, and follow the path of those who turn to Me. You will all return to Me in the end, and I will tell you everything that you have done.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:16" />16: [And Luqman continued], &lsquo;My son, if even the weight of a mustard seed were hidden in a rock or anywhere in the heavens or earth, God would bring it [to light], for He is all subtle and all aware.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:17" />17: Keep up the prayer, my son; command what is right; forbid what is wrong; bear anything that happens to you steadfastly: these are things to be aspired to.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:18" />18: Do not turn your nose up at people, nor walk about the place arrogantly, for God does not love arrogant or boastful people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="31:19" />19: Go at a moderate pace and lower your voice, for the ugliest of all voices is the braying of asses.&rsquo;</p>
