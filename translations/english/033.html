<p class="verse"><a name="2:211" />211: [Prophet], ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We brought them. If anyone alters God&rsquo;s blessings after he has received them, God is stern in punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:212" />212: The life of this world is made to seem glamorous to the disbelievers, and they laugh at those who believe. But those who are mindful of God will be above them on the Day of Resurrection: God provides immeasurably for whoever He pleases.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:213" />213: Mankind was a single community, then God sent prophets to bring good news and warning, and with them He sent the Scripture with the Truth, to judge between people in their disagreements. It was only those to whom it was given who disagreed about it after clear signs had come to them, because of rivalry between them. So by His leave God guided the believers to the truth they had differed about: God guides whoever He will to a straight path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:214" />214: Do you suppose that you will enter the Garden without first having suffered like those before you? They were afflicted by misfortune and hardship, and they were so shaken that even [their] messenger and the believers with him cried, &lsquo;When will God&rsquo;s help arrive?&rsquo; Truly, God&rsquo;s help is near.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:215" />215: They ask you [Prophet] what they should give. Say, &lsquo;Whatever you give should be for parents, close relatives, orphans, the needy, and travellers. God is well aware of whatever good you do.</p>
