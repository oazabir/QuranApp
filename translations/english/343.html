<p class="verse"><a name="23:18" />18: We sent water down from the sky in due measure and lodged it in the earth&ndash;&ndash;We have the power to take it all away if We so wish&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:19" />19: with it We produced for you gardens of date palms and vines, with many fruits there for you to eat,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:20" />20: and a tree, growing out of Mount Sinai, that produces oil and seasoning for your food.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:21" />21: There is a lesson for you in livestock: We produce milk for you to drink from their bellies. And they have many other benefits: you eat them</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:22" />22: and you ride on them, as you do in ships.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:23" />23: We sent Noah to his people. He said, &lsquo;My people, serve God, for He is your only god. Will you not heed Him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:24" />24: But the leading disbelievers among his people said, &lsquo;He is merely a mortal like you, trying to gain some superiority over you. God would have sent down angels if He had wished; besides, we never heard of anything like this from our forefathers.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="23:26" />26: Noah said, &lsquo;My Lord, help me! They call me a liar,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="23:27" />27: and so We revealed to him: &lsquo;Build the Ark under Our watchful eye and according to Our revelation. When Our command comes and water gushes up out of the earth,take pairs of every species on board, and your family, except for those on whom the sentence has already been passed- do not plead with me for the evildoers: they will be drowned-</p>
