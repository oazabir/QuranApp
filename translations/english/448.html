<p class="verse"><a name="37:52" />52: who used to ask me, &ldquo;Do you really believe that</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:53" />53: after we die and become dust and bone, we shall be brought for judgement?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:54" />54: Then he will say, &lsquo;Shall we look for him?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:55" />55: He will look down and see him in the midst of the Fire,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:56" />56: and say to him, &lsquo;By God, you almost brought me to ruin!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:57" />57: Had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I too would have been taken to Hell.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:58" />58: Then he will say [to his blessed companions], &lsquo;Are we never to die again after our earlier death?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:59" />59: Shall we never suffer?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:60" />60: This truly is the supreme triumph!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:61" />61: Everyone should strive to attain this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:62" />62: Is this the better welcome, or the tree of Zaqqum,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:63" />63: which we have made a test for the evildoers?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:64" />64: This tree grows in the heart of the blazing Fire,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:65" />65: and its fruits are like devils&rsquo; heads.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:66" />66: They will fill their bellies eating from it;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:67" />67: then drink scalding water on top of it;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:68" />68: then return to the blazing Fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:69" />69: They found their forefathers astray,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:70" />70: and rushed to follow in their footsteps- before the disbelievers [of Mecca],</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:71" />71: most men in the past went astray,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:72" />72: even though We sent messengers to warn them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:73" />73: See how those who were warned met their end!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:74" />74: Not so the true servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:75" />75: Noah cried to Us, and how excellent was Our response!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="37:76" />76: We saved him and his people from great distress,</p>
