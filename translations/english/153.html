<p class="verse"><a name="7:23" />23: They replied, &lsquo;Our Lord, we have wronged our souls: if You do not forgive us and have mercy, we shall be lost.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:24" />24: He said, &lsquo;All of you get out! You are each other&rsquo;s enemies. On earth you will have a place to stay and livelihood- for a time.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:25" />25: He said, &lsquo;There you will live; there you will die; from there you will be brought out.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:26" />26: Children of Adam, We have given you garments to cover your nakedness and as adornment for you; the garment of God-consciousness is the best of all garments- this is one of God&rsquo;s signs, so that people may take heed.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:27" />27: Children of Adam, do not let Satan seduce you, as he did your parents, causing them to leave the Garden, stripping them of their garments to expose their nakedness to them: he and his forces can see you from where you cannot see them: We have made evil ones allies to those who do not believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:28" />28: Yet when [these people] do something disgraceful, they say, &lsquo;We found our forefathers doing this,&rsquo; and, &lsquo;God has commanded us to do this.&rsquo; Say [Prophet], &lsquo;God does not command disgraceful deeds. How can you say about God things that you do not know [to be true]?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:29" />29: Say, &lsquo;My Lord commands righteousness. Direct your worship straight to Him wherever you pray; call on Him; devote your religion entirely to Him. Just as He first created you, so you will come back [to life] again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:30" />30: Some He has guided and some are doomed to stray: they have taken evil ones rather than God as their masters, thinking that they are rightly guided.</p>
