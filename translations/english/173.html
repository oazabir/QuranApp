<p class="verse"><a name="7:171" />171: When We made the mountain loom high above them like a shadow, and they thought it would fall on them, We said, &lsquo;Hold fast to what We have given you, and remember what it contains, so that you may remain conscious of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:172" />172: [Prophet], when your Lord took out the offspring from the loins of the Children of Adam and made them bear witness about themselves, He said, &lsquo;Am I not your Lord?&rsquo; and they replied, &lsquo;Yes, we bear witness.&rsquo; So you cannot say on the Day of Resurrection, &lsquo;We were not aware of this,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:173" />173: or, &lsquo;It was our forefathers who, before us, ascribed partners to God, and we are only the descendants who came after them: will you destroy us because of falsehoods they invented?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:174" />174: In this way We explain the messages, so that they may turn [to the right path].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:175" />175: [Prophet], tell them the story of the man to whom We gave Our messages: he sloughed them off, so Satan took him as his follower and he went astray-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:176" />176: if it had been Our will, We could have used these signs to raise him high, but instead he clung to the earth and followed his own desires- he was like a dog that pants with a lolling tongue whether you drive it away or leave it alone. Such is the image of those who reject Our signs. Tell them the story so that they may reflect.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:177" />177: How foul is the image of those who reject Our signs! It is themselves they wrong:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:178" />178: whoever God guides is truly guided, and whoever God allows to stray is a loser.</p>
