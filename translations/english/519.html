<p class="verse"><a name="50:16" />16: We created man&ndash;&ndash;We know what his soul whispers to him: We are closer to him than his jugular vein&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:17" />17: with two receptors set to record, one on his right side and one on his left:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:18" />18: he does not utter a single word without an ever-present watcher.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:19" />19: The trance of death will bring the Truth with it: &lsquo;This is what you tried to escape.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:20" />20: The Trumpet will be sounded: &lsquo;This is the Day [you were] warned of.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:21" />21: Each person will arrive attended by an [angel] to drive him on and another to bear witness:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:22" />22: &lsquo;You paid no attention to this [Day]; but today We have removed your veil and your sight is sharp.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:23" />23: The person&rsquo;s attendant will say, &lsquo;Here is what I have prepared&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:24" />24: &lsquo;Hurl every obstinate disbeliever into Hell,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:25" />25: everyone who hindered good, was aggressive, caused others to doubt,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:26" />26: and set up other gods alongside God. Hurl him into severe punishment!&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:27" />27: and his [evil] companion will say, &lsquo;Lord, I did not make him transgress; he had already gone far astray himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:28" />28: God will say, &lsquo;Do not argue in My presence. I sent you a warning</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:29" />29: and My word cannot be changed: I am not unjust to any creature.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:30" />30: We shall say to Hell on that day, &lsquo;Are you full?&rsquo; and it will reply, &lsquo;Are there no more?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:31" />31: But Paradise will be brought close to the righteous and will no longer be distant:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:32" />32: &lsquo;This is what you were promised&ndash;&ndash;this is for everyone who turned often to God and kept Him in mind,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:33" />33: who held the Most Gracious in awe, though He is unseen, who comes before Him with a heart turned to Him in devotion-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:34" />34: so enter it in peace. This is the Day of everlasting Life.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="50:35" />35: They will have all that they wish for there, and We have more for them.</p>
