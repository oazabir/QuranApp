<p class="verse"><a name="8:35" />35: Their prayers before the House are nothing but whistling and clapping. &lsquo;So taste the punishment for your disbelief.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:36" />36: They use their wealth to bar people from the path of God, and they will go on doing so. In the end this will be a source of intense regret for them: they will be overcome and herded towards Hell.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:37" />37: God will separate the bad from the good, place the bad on top of one another- heaping them all up together- and put them in Hell. They will be the losers.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:38" />38: [Prophet], tell the disbelievers that if they desist their past will be forgiven, but if they persist, they have an example in the fate of those who went before.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:39" />39: [Believers], fight them until there is no more persecution, and all worship is devoted to God alone: if they desist, then God sees all that they do,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="8:40" />40: but if they pay no heed, be sure that God is your protector, the best protector and the best helper.</p>
