<p class="verse"><a name="2:84" />84: We took a pledge from you, &lsquo;Do not shed one another&rsquo;s blood or drive one another from your homelands.&rsquo; You acknowledged it at the time, and you can testify to this.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:85" />85: Yet here you are, killing one another and driving some of your own people from their homes, helping one another in sin and aggression against them. If they come to you as captives, you still pay to set them free, although you had no right to drive them out. So do you believe in some parts of the Scripture and not in others? The punishment for those of you who do this will be nothing but disgrace in this life, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be condemned to the harshest torment: God is not unaware of what you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:86" />86: These are the people who buy the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter: their torment will not be lightened, nor will they be helped.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:87" />87: We gave Moses the Scripture and We sent messengers after him in succession. We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear signs and strengthened him with the Holy Spirit. So how is it that, whenever a messenger brings you something you do not like, you become arrogant, calling some impostors and killing others?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:88" />88: They say, &lsquo;Our hearts are impenetrably wrapped [against whatever you say],&rsquo; but God has rejected them for their disbelief: they have little faith.</p>
