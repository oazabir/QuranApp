<p class="verse"><a name="10:44" />44: God does not wrong people at all- it is they who wrong themselves.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:45" />45: On the Day He gathers them together, it will be as if they have stayed [in the world] no longer than a single hour, and they will recognize one another. Those who denied the meeting with God will be the losers, for they did not follow the right guidance.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:46" />46: Whether We let you [Prophet] see some of the punishment We have threatened them with, or cause you to die [first], they will return to Us: God is witness to what they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:47" />47: Every community is sent a mes-senger, and when their messenger comes, they will be judged justly; they will not be wronged.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:48" />48: They ask, &lsquo;When will this promise be fulfilled, if what you say is true?&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="10:50" />50: Say, &lsquo;Think: if His punishment were to come to you, during the night or day, what part of it would the guilty wish to hasten?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:51" />51: Will you believe in it, when it actually happens?&rsquo; It will be said, &lsquo;Now [you believe], when [before] you sought to hasten it?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:52" />52: It will be said to the evildoers, &lsquo;Taste lasting punishment. Why should you be rewarded for anything but what you did?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="10:53" />53: They ask you [Prophet], &lsquo;Is it true?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Yes, by my Lord, it is true, and you cannot escape it.&rsquo;</p>
