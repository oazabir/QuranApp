<p class="verse"><a name="13:15" />15: All that are in heaven and earth submit to God alone, willingly or unwillingly, as do their shadows in the mornings and in the evenings.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="13:16" />16: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Who is Lord of the heavens and the earth?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;God.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Why do you take protectors other than Him, who can neither benefit nor harm even themselves?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;Are the blind equal to those who can see? And are the depths of darkness equal to the light?&rsquo; Have the partners they assign to God created anything like His creation so that their creation is indistinguishable from His?

<p class="verse"><a name="13:18" />18: There will be the best of rewards for those who respond to their Lord; those who do not respond would willingly give away the earth&rsquo;s contents twice over, if they had it, in order to ransom themselves, so terrible will be their reckoning. Hell will be their home, and their bed wretched.</p>
