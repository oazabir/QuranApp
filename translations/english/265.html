<p class="verse"><a name="15:53" />53: &lsquo;Do not be afraid,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;We bring you good news of a son who will have great knowledge.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:54" />54: He said, &lsquo;How can you give me such news when old age has come to me? What sort of news is this?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:55" />55: They said, &lsquo;We have told you the truth, so do not despair.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:56" />56: He said, &lsquo;Who but the misguided despair of the mercy of their Lord?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:57" />57: and then asked, &lsquo;Messengers, what is your errand?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:58" />58: They replied, &lsquo;We have been sent to a people who are guilty.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:59" />59: But We shall save the household of Lot,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:60" />60: all except his wife: We have decreed that she will be one of those who stay behind.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:61" />61: When the messengers came to the household of Lot,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:62" />62: he said, &lsquo;You are strangers.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="15:64" />64: we have brought you the Truth. We speak truly,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:65" />65: so leave in the dead of the night with your household, and walk behind them. Let none of you look back. Go where you are commanded.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:66" />66: We made this decree known to him: the last remnants of those people would be wiped out in the morning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:67" />67: The people of the town came along, revelling,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:68" />68: and he told them, &lsquo;These are my guests, do not disgrace me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:69" />69: Fear God, and do not shame me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="15:70" />70: They answered, &lsquo;Have we not told you not to interfere [between us and] anyone else?&rsquo;</p>
