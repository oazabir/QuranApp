<p class="verse"><a name="33:7" />7: We took a solemn pledge from the prophets- from you [Muhammad], from Noah, from Abraham, from Moses, from Jesus, son of Mary- We took a solemn pledge from all of them:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:8" />8: God will question [even] the truthful about their sincerity, and for those who reject the truth He has prepared a painful torment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:9" />9: You who believe, remember God&rsquo;s goodness to you when mighty armies massed against you: We sent a violent wind and invisible forces against them. God sees all that you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:10" />10: They massed against you from above and below; your eyes rolled [with fear], your hearts rose into your throats, and you thought [ill] thoughts of God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:11" />11: There the believers were sorely tested and deeply shaken:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:12" />12: the hypocrites and the sick at heart said, &lsquo;God and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusions!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:13" />13: Some of them said, &lsquo;People of Yathrib, you will not be able to withstand [the attack], so go back!&rsquo; Some of them asked the Prophet&rsquo;s permission to leave, saying, &lsquo;Our houses are exposed,&rsquo; even though they were not- they just wanted to run away:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:14" />14: had the city been invaded from all sides, and the enemy invited them to rebel, they would have done so almost without hesitation.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="33:15" />15: Yet they had already promised God that they would not turn tail and flee, and a promise to God will be answered for.</p>
