<p class="verse"><a name="4:80" />80: Whoever obeys the Messenger obeys God. If some pay no heed, We have not sent you to be their keeper.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:81" />81: They say, &lsquo;We obey you,&rsquo; but as soon as they leave your presence, some of them scheme by night to do other than what you said. God records what they scheme, so leave them alone, and put your trust in God: He is sufficient protector.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:82" />82: Will they not think about this Quran? If it had been from anyone other than God, they would have found much inconsistency in it.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:83" />83: Whenever news of any matter comes to them, whether concerning peace or war, they spread it about; if they referred it to the Messenger and those in authority among them, those seeking its meaning would have found it out from them. If it were not for God&rsquo;s bounty and mercy towards you, you would almost all have followed Satan.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:84" />84: So [Prophet] fight in God&rsquo;s way. You are accountable only for yourself. Urge the believers on. God may well curb the power of the disbelievers, for He is stronger in might and more terrible in punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:85" />85: Whoever speaks for a good cause will share in its benefits and whoever speaks for a bad cause will share in its burden: God controls everything.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:86" />86: But [even in battle] when you [believers] are offered a greeting, respond with a better one, or at least return it: God keeps account of everything.</p>
