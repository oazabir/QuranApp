<p class="verse"><a name="7:188" />188: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;I have no control over benefit or harm, [even] to myself, except as God may please: if I had knowledge of what is hidden, I would have abundant good things and no harm could touch me. I am no more than a bearer of warning, and good news to those who believe.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:189" />189: It is He who created you all from one soul, and from it made its mate so that he might find comfort in her: when one [of them] lies with his wife and she conceives a light burden, going about freely, then grows heavy, they both pray to God, their Lord, &lsquo;If You give us a good child we shall certainly be grateful,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:190" />190: and yet when He gives them a good child they ascribe some of what He has granted them to others.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:191" />191: God is far above the partners they set up alongside Him! How can they set up with Him these partners that create nothing and are themselves created,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:192" />192: that cannot help them at all, or even help themselves?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:193" />193: If you [believers] call such people to guidance, they do not fol-low you: it makes no difference whether you call them or remain silent.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:194" />194: Those you [idolaters] call upon instead of God are created beings like you. Call upon them, then, and let them respond to you if what you say is true.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:195" />195: Do they have feet to walk, hands to strike, eyes to see, or ears to hear? Say [Prophet], &lsquo;Call on your &ldquo;partners&rdquo;! Scheme against me! Do not spare me!</p>
