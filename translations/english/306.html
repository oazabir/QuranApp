<p class="verse"><a name="19:12" />12: [We said], &lsquo;John, hold on to the Scripture firmly.&rsquo; While he was still a boy, We granted him wisdom,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:13" />13: tenderness from Us, and purity. He was devout,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:14" />14: kind to his parents, not domineering or rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:15" />15: Peace was on him the day he was born, the day he died, and it will be on him the day he is raised to life again.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:16" />16: Mention in the Quran the story of Mary. She withdrew from her family to a place to the east</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:17" />17: and secluded herself away; We sent Our Spirit to appear before her in the form of a perfected man.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:18" />18: She said, &lsquo;I seek the Lord of Mercy&rsquo;s protection against you: if you have any fear of Him [do not approach]!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:19" />19: but he said, &lsquo;I am but a Mes-senger from your Lord, [come] to announce to you the gift of a pure son.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:20" />20: She said, &lsquo;How can I have a son when no man has touched me? I have not been unchaste,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:21" />21: and he said, &lsquo;This is what your Lord said: &ldquo;It is easy for Me- We shall make him a sign to all people, a blessing from Us.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:22" />22: And so it was ordained: she conceived him. She withdrew to a distant place</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:23" />23: and, when the pains of childbirth drove her to [cling to] the trunk of a palm tree, she exclaimed, &lsquo;I wish I had been dead and forgotten long before all this!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:24" />24: but a voice cried to her from below, &lsquo;Do not worry: your Lord has provided a stream at your feet</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="19:25" />25: and, if you shake the trunk of the palm tree towards you, it will deliver fresh ripe dates for you,</p>
