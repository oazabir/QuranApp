<p class="verse"><a name="2:240" />240: If any of you die and leave widows, make a bequest for them: a year&rsquo;s maintenance and no expulsion from their homes [for that time].

<p class="verse"><a name="2:241" />241: Divorced women shall also have such maintenance as is considered fair: this is a duty for those who are mindful of God.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="2:243" />243: [Prophet], consider those people who abandoned their homeland in fear of death, even though there were thousands of them.

<p class="verse"><a name="2:244" />244: Fight in God&rsquo;s cause and remember that He is all hearing and all knowing.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:245" />245: Who will give God a good loan, which He will increase for him many times over? It is God who withholds and God who gives abundantly, and it is to Him that you will return.</p>
