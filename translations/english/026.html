<p class="verse"><a name="2:171" />171: Calling to disbelieversis like a herdsman calling to things that hear nothing but a shout and a cry: they are deaf, dumb, and blind, and they understand nothing.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="2:174" />174: As for those who conceal the Scripture that God sent down and sell it for a small price, they only fill their bellies with Fire. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them: an agonizing torment awaits them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:175" />175: These are the ones who exchange guidance for error, and forgiveness for torment. What can make them patient in the face of the Fire?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:176" />176: This is because God has sent the Scripture with the Truth; those who pursue differences in the Scripture are deeply entrenched in opposition.</p>
