<p class="verse"><a name="75:20" />20: Truly you [people] love this fleeting world</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:21" />21: and neglect the life to come.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:22" />22: On that Day there will be radiant faces,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:23" />23: looking towards their Lord,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:24" />24: and on that Day there will be the sad and despairing faces</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:25" />25: of those who realize that a great calamity is about to befall them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:26" />26: Truly, when the soul reaches the collarbone;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:27" />27: when it is said, &lsquo;Could any charm-healer save him now?&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:28" />28: when he knows it is the final parting;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:29" />29: when his legs are brought together:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:30" />30: on that day he will be driven towards your Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:31" />31: He neither believed nor prayed,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:32" />32: but denied the truth and turned away,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:33" />33: walking back to his people with a conceited swagger.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:34" />34: Closer and closer it comes to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:35" />35: Closer and closer still.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:36" />36: Does man think he will be left alone?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:37" />37: Was he not just a drop of spilt-out sperm,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:38" />38: which became a clinging form, which God shaped in due proportion,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:39" />39: fashioning from it the two sexes, male and female?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="75:40" />40: Does He who can do this not have the power to bring the dead back to life?</p>
<p class="surah">Al-Insan</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:1" />1: Was there not a period of time when man was nothing to speak of ?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:2" />2: We created man from a drop of mingled fluid to put him to the test; We gave him hearing and sight;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:3" />3: We guided him to the right path, whether he was grateful or not.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:4" />4: We have prepared chains, iron collars, and blazing Fire for the disbelievers, but</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="76:5" />5: the righteous will have a drink mixed with kafur,</p>
