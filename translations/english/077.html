<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:1" />1: People, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them spread countless men and women far and wide; be mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another. Beware of severing the ties of kinship: God is always watching over you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:2" />2: Give orphans their property, do not replace [their] good things with bad, and do not consume their property with your own- a great sin.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:3" />3: If you fear that you will not deal fairly with orphan girls, you may marry whichever [other] women seem good to you, two, three, or four. If you fear that you cannot be equitable [to them], then marry only one, or your slave(s): that is more likely to make you avoid bias.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:4" />4: Give women their bridal gift upon marriage, though if they are happy to give up some of it for you, you may enjoy it with a clear conscience.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:5" />5: Do not entrust your property to the feeble-minded. God has made it a means of support for you: make provision for them from it, clothe them, and address them kindly.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:6" />6: Test orphans until they reach marriageable age; then, if you find they have sound judgement, hand over their property to them. Do not consume it hastily before they come of age: if the guardian is well off he should abstain from the orphan&rsquo;s property, and if he is poor he should use only what is fair. When you give them their property, call witnesses in; but God takes full account of everything you do.</p>
