<p class="verse"><a name="4:118" />118: God rejected, who said, &lsquo;I will certainly take my due share of Your servants;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="4:119" />119: I will mislead them and incite vain desires in them; I will command them to slit the ears of cattle; I will command them to tamper with God&rsquo;s creation.&rsquo; Whoever chooses Satan as a patron instead of God is utterly ruined:</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="4:121" />121: Such people will have Hell for their home and will find no escape from it,</p>
