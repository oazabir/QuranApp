<p class="verse"><a name="11:90" />90: Ask forgiveness from your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance: my Lord is merciful and most loving.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:91" />91: They said, &lsquo;Shuayb, we do not understand much of what you say, and we find you very weak in our midst. But for your family, we would have stoned you, for you have no great status among us.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="11:93" />93: My people, do whatever is within your power, and I will do likewise. Soon you will know who will receive a disgraceful punishment and who is a liar. Watch out, and so will I.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:94" />94: When what We had ordained came about, in Our mercy We saved Shuayb and his fellow believers, but a mighty blast struck the wrongdoers. By morning they lay dead in their homes,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:95" />95: as if they had never lived and flourished there. Yes, away with the people of Midian, just like the Thamud!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="11:96" />96: We also sent Moses, with Our signs and clear authority,</p>
