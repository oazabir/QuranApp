<p class="verse"><a name="7:38" />38: God will say, &lsquo;Join the crowds of jinn and humans who have gone before you into the Fire.&rsquo; Every crowd curses its fellow crowd as it enters, then, when they are all gathered inside, the last of them will say of the first, &lsquo;Our Lord, it was they who led us astray: give them double punishment in the Fire&rsquo;- God says, &lsquo;Every one of you will have double punishment, though you do not know it&rsquo;-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:39" />39: and the first of them will say to the last, &lsquo;You were no better than us: taste the punishment you have earned.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:40" />40: The gates of Heaven will not be open to those who rejected Our revelations and arrogantly spurned them; even if a thick rope were to pass through the eye of a needle they would not enter the Garden. This is how We punish the guilty-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:41" />41: Hell will be their resting place and their covering, layer upon layer- this is how We punish those who do evil.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:42" />42: But those who believe and do good deeds- and We do not burden any soul with more than it can bear- are the people of the Garden and there they will remain.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:43" />43: We shall have removed all ill feeling from their hearts; streams will flow at their feet. They will say, &lsquo;Praise be to God, who guided us to this: had God not guided us, We would never have found the way. The messengers of our Lord brought the Truth.&rsquo; A voice will call out to them, &lsquo;This is the Garden you have been given as your own on account of your deeds.&rsquo;</p>
