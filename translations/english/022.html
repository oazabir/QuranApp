<p class="verse"><a name="2:142" />142: The foolish people will say, &lsquo;What has turned them away from the prayer direction they used to face?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;East and West belong to God. He guides whoever He will to the right way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:143" />143: We have made you [believers] into a just community, so that you may bear witness [to the truth] before others and so that the Messenger may bear witness [to it] before you. We only made the direction the one you used to face [Prophet] in order to distinguish those who follow the Messenger from those who turn on their heels: that test was hard, except for those God has guided. God would never let your faith go to waste [believers], for God is most compassionate and most merciful towards people.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:144" />144: Many a time We have seen you [Prophet] turn your face towards Heaven, so We are turning you towards a prayer direction that pleases you. Turn your face in the direction of the Sacred Mosque: wherever you [believers] may be, turn your faces to it. Those who were given the Scripture know with certainty that this is the Truth from their Lord: God is not unaware of what they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="2:145" />145: Yet even if you brought every proof to those who were given the Scripture, they would not follow your prayer direction, nor will you follow theirs, nor indeed will any of them follow one another&rsquo;s direction. If you [Prophet] were to follow their desires, after the knowledge brought to you, you would be doing wrong.</p>
