<p class="verse"><a name="5:10" />10: those who reject faith and deny Our revelations will inhabit the blazing Fire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:11" />11: You who believe, remember God&rsquo;s blessing on you when a certain people were about to raise their hands against you and He restrained them. Be mindful of God: let the believers put their trust in Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:12" />12: God took a pledge from the Children of Israel. We made twelve leaders arise among them, and God said, &lsquo;I am with you: if you keep up the prayer, pay the prescribed alms, believe in My messengers and support them, and lend God a good loan, I will wipe out your sins and admit you into Gardens graced with flowing streams. Any of you who now ignore this [pledge] will be far from the right path.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:13" />13: But they broke their pledge, so We distanced them [from Us] and hardened their hearts. They distort the meaning of [revealed] words and have forgotten some of what they were told to remember: you [Prophet] will always find treachery in all but a few of them. Overlook this and pardon them: God loves those who do good.</p>
