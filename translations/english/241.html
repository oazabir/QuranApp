<p class="verse"><a name="12:45" />45: but the prisoner who had been freed at last remembered [Joseph] and said, &lsquo;I shall tell you what this means. Give me leave to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:46" />46: &lsquo;Truthful Joseph! Tell us the meaning of seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean ones, seven green ears of corn and [seven] others withered,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:47" />47: then I can return to the people to inform them.&rsquo; Joseph said, &lsquo;You will sow for seven consecutive years as usual. Store all that you reap, left in the ear, apart from the little you eat.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="12:52" />52: [Joseph said, &lsquo;This was] for my master to know that I did not betray him behind his back: God does not guide the mischief of the treacherous.</p>
