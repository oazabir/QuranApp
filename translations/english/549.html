<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="60:1" />1: You who believe, do not take My enemies and yours as your allies, showing them friendship when they have rejected the truth you have received, and have driven you and the Messenger out simply because you believe in God, your Lord&ndash;&ndash;not if you truly emigrated in order to strive for My cause and seek My good pleasure. You secretly show them friendship&ndash;&ndash;I know all you conceal and all you reveal&ndash;&ndash; but any of you who do this are straying from the right path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="60:2" />2: If they gain the upper hand over you, they will revert to being your enemies and stretch out their hands and tongues to harm you; it is their dearest wish that you may renounce your faith.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="60:3" />3: Neither your kinsfolk nor your children will be any use to you on the Day of Resurrection: He will separate you out. God sees everything you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="60:4" />4: You have a good example in Abraham and his companions, when they said to their people, &lsquo;We disown you and what you worship besides God! We renounce you! Until you believe in God alone, the enmity and hatred that has arisen between us will endure!&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;except when Abraham said to his father, &lsquo;I will pray for forgiveness for you though I cannot protect you from God&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;[they prayed]</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="60:5" />5: &lsquo;Lord, we have put our trust in You; we turn to You; You are our final destination. Lord, do not expose us to mistreatment [at the hands of] the disbelievers. Forgive us, Lord, for You are the Almighty, the All Wise.&rsquo;</p>
