<p class="verse"><a name="48:11" />11: The desert Arabs who stayed behind will say to you, &lsquo;We were busy with our property and our families: ask forgiveness for us,&rsquo; but they say with their tongues what is not in their hearts.

<p class="verse"><a name="48:14" />14: Control of the heavens and earth belongs to God and He forgives whoever He will and punishes whoever He will: God is most forgiving and merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="48:15" />15: When you [believers] set off for somewhere that promises war gains, those who [previously] stayed behind will say, &lsquo;Let us come with you.&rsquo; They want to change God&rsquo;s words, but tell them [Prophet], &lsquo;You may not come with us: God has said this before.&rsquo; They will reply, &lsquo;You begrudge us out of jealousy.&rsquo; How little they understand!</p>
