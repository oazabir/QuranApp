<p class="verse"><a name="6:53" />53: We have made some of them a test for others, to make the disbelievers say, &lsquo;Is it these men that God has favoured among us?&rsquo; Does God not know best who are the grateful ones?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:54" />54: When those who believe in Our revelations come to you [Prophet], say, &lsquo;Peace be upon you. Your Lord has taken it on Himself to be merciful: if any of you has foolishly done a bad deed, and afterwards repented and mended his ways, God is most forgiving and most merciful.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:55" />55: In this way We explain the revelations, so that the way for sinners may be made clear.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:56" />56: Say, &lsquo;I am forbidden to worship those you call on other than God.&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;I will not follow your vain desires, for if I did, I would stray from the path and cease to be rightly guided.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:57" />57: Say, &lsquo;I stand on clear proof from my Lord, though you deny it. What you seek to hasten is not within my power. Judgement is for God alone: He tells the truth, and He is the best of judges.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:58" />58: Say, &lsquo;If what you seek to hasten were within my power, the matter would be settled between you and me, but God knows best who does wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="6:59" />59: He has the keys to the unseen: no one knows them but Him. He knows all that is in the land and sea. No leaf falls without His knowledge, nor is there a single grain in the darkness of the earth, or anything, fresh or withered, that is not written in a clear Record.</p>
