<p class="verse"><a name="24:37" />37: men who are not distracted, either by commerce or profit, from remembering God, keeping up the prayer, and paying the prescribed alms, fearing a day when hearts and eyes will turn over.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:38" />38: God will reward such people according to the best of their actions, and He will give them more of His bounty: God provides limitlessly for anyone He will.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:39" />39: But the deeds of those who disbelieve are like a mirage in a desert: the thirsty person thinks there will be water but, when he gets there, he finds only God, who pays him his account in full- God is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:40" />40: Or like shadows in a deep sea covered by wave upon wave, with clouds above- layer upon layer of darkness- if he holds out his hand, he is scarcely able to see it. The one to whom God gives no light has no light at all.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:41" />41: [Prophet], do you not see that all those who are in the heavens and earth praise God, as do the birds with wings outstretched? Each knows its [own way] of prayer and glorification: God has full knowledge of what they do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:42" />42: Control of the heavens and earth belongs to God: and to God is the final return.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="24:43" />43: Do you not see that God drives the clouds, then gathers them together and piles them up until you see rain pour from their midst? He sends hail down from [such] mountains in the sky, pouring it on whoever He wishes and diverting it from whoever He wishes- the flash of its lightning almost snatches sight away.</p>
