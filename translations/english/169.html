Were you so keen to bring your Lord&rsquo;s judgement forward?&rsquo; He threw the tablets down and seized his brother by the hair, pulling him towards him. Aaron said, &lsquo;Son of my mother, these people overpowered me! They almost killed me! Do not give my enemies reason to rejoice! Do not include me with these evildoers!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:151" />151: Moses said, &lsquo;My Lord, forgive me and my brother; accept us into Your mercy: You are the Most Merciful of all who show mercy.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="7:153" />153: but your Lord is most forgiving and most merciful towards those who do wrong, then repent afterwards and truly believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:154" />154: When Moses&rsquo; anger abated, he picked up the Tablets, on which were inscribed guidance and mercy for those who stood in awe of their Lord.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="7:155" />155: Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment, and when they were seized by trembling, he prayed, &lsquo;My Lord, if You had chosen to do so, You could have destroyed them long before this, and me too, so will You now destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is only a trial from You- through it, You cause whoever You will to stray and guide whoever You will- and You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy on us. You are the best of those who forgive.</p>
