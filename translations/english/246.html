<p class="verse"><a name="12:87" />87: My sons, go and seek news of Joseph and his brother and do not despair of God&rsquo;s mercy- only disbelievers despair of God&rsquo;s mercy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:88" />88: Then, when they presented themselves before Joseph, they said, &lsquo;Mighty governor, misfortune has afflicted us and our family. We have brought only a little merchandise, but give us full measure. Be charitable to us: God rewards the charitable.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:89" />89: He said, &lsquo;Do you now realize what you did to Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:90" />90: and they cried, &lsquo;Could it be that you are Joseph?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;I am Joseph. This is my brother. God has been gracious to us: God does not deny anyone who is mindful of God and steadfast in adversity the rewards of those who do good.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:91" />91: They said, &lsquo;By God! God really did favour you over all of us and we were in the wrong!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:92" />92: but he said, &lsquo;You will hear no reproaches today. May God forgive you: He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:93" />93: Take my shirt and lay it over my father&rsquo;s face: he will recover his sight. Then bring your whole family back to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:94" />94: Later, when the caravan departed, their father said, &lsquo;You may think I am senile but I can smell Joseph,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="12:95" />95: but [people] said, &lsquo;By God! You are still lost in that old illusion of yours!&rsquo;</p>
