<p class="verse"><a name="26:84" />84: give me a good name among later generations;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:85" />85: make me one of those given the Garden of Bliss-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:86" />86: forgive my father, for he is one of those who have gone astray-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:87" />87: and do not disgrace me on the Day when all people are resurrected:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:88" />88: the Day when neither wealth nor children can help,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:89" />89: when the only one who will be saved is the one who comes before God with a heart devoted to Him.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:90" />90: When the Garden is brought near to the righteous</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:91" />91: and the Fire is placed in full view of the misguided,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:92" />92: it will be said to them, &lsquo;Where are those you worshipped</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:93" />93: beside God? Can they help you now, or even help themselves?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:94" />94: and then they will all be hurled into Hell, together with those that misled them,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:95" />95: and all Iblis&rsquo;s supporters.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:96" />96: There they will say to their gods, as they bicker among themselves,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:97" />97: &lsquo;We were clearly misguided</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:98" />98: when we made you equal with the Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:99" />99: It was the evildoers who led us astray,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:100" />100: and now we have no intercessor</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:101" />101: and no true friend.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:102" />102: If only we could live our lives again, we would be true believers!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:103" />103: There truly is a sign in this, though most of them do not believe:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:104" />104: your Lord alone is the Almighty, the Merciful.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:105" />105: The people of Noah, too, called the messengers liars.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:106" />106: Their brother Noah said to them, &lsquo;Will you not be mindful of God?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:107" />107: I am a faithful messenger sent to you:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:108" />108: be mindful of God and obey me.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:109" />109: I ask no reward of you, for my only reward is with the Lord of the Worlds:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:110" />110: be mindful of God and obey me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="26:111" />111: They answered, &lsquo;Why should we believe you when the worst sort of people follow you?&rsquo;</p>
