<p class="verse"><a name="59:4" />4: because they set themselves against God and His Messenger: God is stern in punishment towards anyone who sets himself against Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:5" />5: Whatever you [believers] may have done to [their] palm trees&ndash;&ndash; cutting them down or leaving them standing on their roots&ndash;&ndash;was done by God&rsquo;s leave, so that He might disgrace those who defied Him.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:6" />6: You [believers] did not have to spur on your horses or your camels for whatever gains God turned over to His Messenger from them. God gives authority to His messengers over whoever He will: God has power over all things.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:7" />7: Whatever gains God has turned over to His Messenger from the inhabitants of the villages belong to God, the Messenger, kinsfolk, orphans, the needy, the traveller in need- this is so that they do not just circulate among those of you who are rich&ndash;&ndash;so accept whatever the Messenger gives you, and abstain from whatever he forbids you. Be mindful of God: God is severe in punishment.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:8" />8: The poor emigrants who were driven from their homes and possessions, who seek God&rsquo;s favour and approval, those who help God and His Messenger- these are the ones who are true- [shall have a share].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="59:9" />9: Those who were already firmly established in their homes [in Medina], and firmly rooted in faith, show love for those who migrated to them for refuge and harbour no desire in their hearts for what has been given to them. They give them preference over themselves, even if they too are poor: those who are saved from their own souls&rsquo; greed are truly successful.</p>
