<p class="verse"><a name="38:17" />17: Bear their words patiently [Prophet]. Remember Our servant David, a man of strength who always turned to Us:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:18" />18: We made the mountains join him in glorifying Us at sunset and sunrise;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:19" />19: and the birds, too, in flocks, all echoed his praise.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:20" />20: We strengthened his kingdom; We gave him wisdom and a decisive way of speaking.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:21" />21: Have you heard the story of the two litigants who climbed into his private quarters?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:22" />22: When they reached David, he took fright, but they said, &lsquo;Do not be afraid. We are two litigants, one of whom has wronged the other: judge between us fairly- do not be unjust- and guide us to the right path.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:23" />23: This is my brother. He had ninety-nine ewes and I just the one, and he said, &ldquo;Let me take charge of her,&rdquo; and overpowered me with his words.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:24" />24: David said, &lsquo;He has done you wrong by demanding to add your ewe to his flock. Many partners treat each other unfairly. Those who sincerely believe and do good deeds do not do this, but these are very few.&rsquo; [Then] David realized that We had been testing him, so he asked his Lord for forgiveness, fell down on his knees, and repented:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:25" />25: We forgave him [his misdeed]. His reward will be nearness to Us, a good place to return to.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="38:26" />26: &lsquo;David, We have given you mastery over the land. Judge fairly between people. Do not follow your desires, lest they divert you from God&rsquo;s path: those who wander from His path will have a painful torment because they ignore the Day of Reckoning.&rsquo;</p>
