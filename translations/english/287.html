<p class="verse"><a name="17:50" />50: Say, &lsquo;[Yes] even if you were [as hard as] stone, or iron,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:51" />51: or any other substance you think hard to bring to life.&rsquo; Then they will say, &lsquo;Who will bring us back?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;The One who created you the first time.&rsquo; Then they will shake their heads at you and say, &lsquo;When will that be?&rsquo; Say, &lsquo;It may well be very soon:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:52" />52: it will be the Day when He calls you, and you answer by praising Him, and you think you have stayed [on earth] only a little while.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:53" />53: [Prophet], tell My servants to say what is best. Satan sows discord among them: Satan is a sworn enemy of man.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:54" />54: Your Lord has the most knowledge about all of you: if He pleases He will have mercy on you, and if He pleases He will punish you. [Prophet], We did not send you to take charge of them.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:55" />55: Your Lord knows best about everyone in the heavens and the earth. We gave some prophets more than others: We gave David a book [of Psalms].</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:56" />56: Say, &lsquo;Call upon those you claim to be deities beside God: they have no power to remove or avert any harm from you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:57" />57: Those [angels] they pray to are themselves seeking a way to their Lord, even those who are closest to Him. They hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. The punishment of your Lord is much to be feared:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="17:58" />58: there is no community We shall not destroy, or punish severely, before the Day of Resurrection- this is written in the Book.</p>
