<p class="verse"><a name="5:83" />83: and when they listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger, you will see their eyes overflowing with tears because they recognize the Truth [in it]. They say, &lsquo;Our Lord, we believe, so count us amongst the witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:84" />84: Why should we not believe in God and in the Truth that has come down to us, when we long for our Lord to include us in the company of the righteous?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:85" />85: For saying this, God has rewarded them with Gardens graced with flowing streams, and there they will stay: that is the reward of those who do good.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:86" />86: Those who reject the truth and deny Our messages will be the inhabitants of Hellfire.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:87" />87: You who believe, do not forbid the good things God has made lawful to you- do not exceed the limits: God does not love those who exceed the limits-</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:88" />88: but eat the lawful and good things that God provides for you. Be mindful of God, in whom you believe.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="5:89" />89: God does not take you [to task] for what is thoughtless in your oaths, only for your binding oaths: the atonement for breaking an oath is to feed ten poor people with food equivalent to what you would normally give your own families, or to clothe them, or to set free a slave- if a person cannot find the means, he should fast for three days. This is the atonement for breaking your oaths- keep your oaths. In this way God makes clear His revelations to you, so that you may be thankful.</p>
