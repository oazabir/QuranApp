<p class="verse"><a name="34:32" />32: The oppressors will say to them, &lsquo;Was it we who prevented you from following right guidance after it had reached you? No! You yourselves were sinners.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:33" />33: The oppressed will say to them, &lsquo;No, it was your scheming, night and day, ordering us to disbelieve in God and set up rivals to Him.&rsquo; When they see the punishment, they will fall silent with regret, and We shall put iron collars on the disbelievers&rsquo; necks. Why should they be rewarded for anything other than what they have done?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:34" />34: Never have We sent a warner to a community without those among them who were corrupted by wealth saying, &lsquo;We do not believe in the message you have been sent with.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:35" />35: They would say, &lsquo;We have greater wealth and more children than you, and we shall not be punished.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:36" />36: Say [Prophet], &lsquo;My Lord gives in abundance to whoever He will and sparingly to whoever He will, though most people do not understand.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:37" />37: Neither wealth nor children will bring you nearer to Us, but those who believe and do good deeds will have multiple rewards for what they have done, and will live safely in the lofty dwellings of Paradise,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:38" />38: whereas those who work against Our messages, seeking to undermine them, will be summoned to punishment.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="34:39" />39: Say, &lsquo;My Lord gives in abundance to whichever of His servants He will, and sparingly to whichever He will; He will replace whatever you give in alms; He is the best of providers.&rsquo;</p>
