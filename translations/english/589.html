<p class="verse"><a name="83:36" />36: Have the disbelievers [not] been repaid for their deeds?</p>
<p class="surah">Al-Inshiqaq</p>
<p class="bismillah">In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy!</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:1" />1: When the sky is ripped apart,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:2" />2: obeying its Lord as it rightly must,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:3" />3: when the earth is levelled out,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:4" />4: casts out its contents, and becomes empty,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:5" />5: obeying its Lord as it rightly must,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:6" />6: you humans, toiling laboriously towards your Lord, will meet Him:</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:7" />7: whoever is given his record in his right hand</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:8" />8: will have an easy reckoning</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:9" />9: and return to his people well pleased,</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:10" />10: but whoever is given his record from behind his back</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:11" />11: will cry out for destruction&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:12" />12: he will burn in the blazing Fire.</p>

<p class="verse"><a name="84:19" />19: you will progress from stage to stage.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:20" />20: So why do they not believe?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:21" />21: Why, when the Quran is read to them, do they not prostrate themselves [to God]?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:22" />22: No! The disbelievers reject the Quran&ndash;&ndash;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="84:23" />23: God knows best what they keep hidden inside&ndash;&ndash;</p>
