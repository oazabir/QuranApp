<p class="verse"><a name="57:4" />4: It was He who created the heavens and earth in six Days and then established Himself on the throne. He knows what enters the earth and what comes out of it; what descends from the sky and what ascends to it. He is with you wherever you are; He sees all that you do;</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:5" />5: control of the heavens and earth belongs to Him. Everything is brought back to God.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:6" />6: He makes night merge into day and day into night. He knows what is in every heart.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:7" />7: Believe in God and His Messenger, and give out of what He has made pass down to you: those of you who believe and give will have a great reward.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:8" />8: Why should you not believe in God when the Mes-senger calls you to believe in your Lord, and He has already made a pledge with you, if you have faith?</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:9" />9: It is He who has sent down clear revelations to His Servant, so that He may bring you from the depths of darkness into light; God is truly kind and merciful to you.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:10" />10: Why should you not give for God&rsquo;s cause when God alone will inherit what is in the heavens and earth? Those who gave and fought before the triumph are not like others: they are greater in rank than those who gave and fought afterwards. But God has promised a good reward to all of them: God is fully aware of all that you do.</p>
<p class="verse"><a name="57:11" />11: Who will make God a good loan? He will double it for him and reward him generously.</p>
